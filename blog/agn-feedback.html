        <p>
            One of the most fascinating questions in modern astrophysics is how galaxies regulate their
            star formation over cosmic time. While gravity wants to pull gas together to form stars,
            something must counteract this process to explain why massive galaxies stopped forming stars
            billions of years ago. Enter Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) – supermassive black holes that
            might hold the key to this cosmic mystery.
        </p>

        <h2>What is AGN Feedback?</h2>

        <p>
            At the center of most massive galaxies lurks a supermassive black hole, millions to billions
            of times the mass of our Sun. When these black holes actively accrete matter, they become
            Active Galactic Nuclei, releasing enormous amounts of energy that can rival the entire stellar
            output of their host galaxy.
        </p>

        <p>
            This energy doesn't just disappear – it couples to the surrounding gas through various mechanisms:
        </p>

        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li><strong>Radiation pressure:</strong> Photons from the accretion disk push on gas</li>
            <li><strong>Winds:</strong> Fast-moving outflows driven by radiation or magnetic fields</li>
            <li><strong>Jets:</strong> Collimated relativistic outflows along the black hole's rotation axis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>

        <p>
            AGN feedback is thought to be the primary mechanism that "quenches" star formation in massive
            galaxies. Without it, simulations predict that galaxies would continue forming stars at high
            rates, producing far more massive galaxies than we observe. The energy injected by AGN can:
        </p>

        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Heat gas to temperatures too high for star formation</li>
            <li>Expel gas from the galaxy entirely</li>
            <li>Prevent cooling flows in galaxy clusters</li>
            <li>Regulate the growth of both the black hole and its host galaxy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Observing AGN Outflows</h2>

        <p>
            My research focuses on directly observing these outflows using integral field spectroscopy.
            With instruments like the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), we can map the velocity structure
            of ionized gas across entire galaxies. By analyzing emission lines like [OIII] λ5007, we can:
        </p>

        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Measure outflow velocities (often 500-1000 km/s or more)</li>
            <li>Determine the spatial extent of the outflow</li>
            <li>Calculate mass outflow rates</li>
            <li>Estimate the kinetic energy being injected into the ISM</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>

        <p>
            While AGN feedback is theoretically compelling, observationally confirming its impact is
            challenging. We need to show that:
        </p>

        <ol style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Outflows carry enough energy to affect the galaxy</li>
            <li>The outflows actually escape the galaxy (or at least the star-forming regions)</li>
            <li>The timescales are consistent with observed quenching</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Current observations suggest that while AGN outflows are energetic, they may not always be
            efficient at removing gas from galaxies. Some of the gas might fall back, or the outflows
            might primarily heat rather than expel gas.
        </p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>

        <p>
            Next-generation facilities like JWST and the upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes will allow
            us to study AGN feedback at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. We'll be able to:
        </p>

        <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Trace outflows to larger distances from the nucleus</li>
            <li>Study feedback in the early universe when it was most important</li>
            <li>Resolve the multiphase structure of outflows</li>
            <li>Better constrain the coupling efficiency between AGN energy and gas</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Understanding AGN feedback isn't just about black holes – it's about understanding how
            galaxies like our own Milky Way came to be. Every time we map an outflow or measure a
            velocity field, we're adding another piece to this cosmic puzzle.
