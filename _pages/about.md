This is the personal website of Saloni Agrawal.

I am an Undergraduate Researcher at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), majoring in Physics with a specialization in Astrophysics and minoring in Mathematics and Computer Science.

My research focuses on:
*   **Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)**: Studying outflows using KCWI spectroscopy with Dr. Alison Coil.
*   **Globular Cluster Dynamics**: Investigating binary mass fractions and black hole retention using CMC-COSMIC simulations with Dr. Kyle Kremer.
*   **Dark Matter Detection**: Characterizing backgrounds in the XENONnT detector with Dr. Kaixuan Ni.
*   **Machine Learning**: Applying ML to particle physics (JetNet) with Dr. Javier Duarte.

I am passionate about using computational tools to solve complex astrophysical problems.

Feel free to explore my [CV](/cv/) to learn more about my background and experience.
