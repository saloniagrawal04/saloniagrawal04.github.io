Hi, I'm **Saloni Agrawal**.

I'm an undergraduate researcher at **UCSD**, studying **Physics (Astrophysics)**, **Math**, and **CS**.

I work on **AGN outflows** with [Dr. Alison Coil](https://cass.ucsd.edu/~acoil/), **Globular Cluster dynamics** with [Dr. Kyle Kremer](https://kylekremer.github.io/), and **Dark Matter detection** with [Dr. Kaixuan Ni](https://physics.ucsd.edu/Directory/Person?name=Kaixuan%20Ni).

I've also worked on **Machine Learning** for particle physics with [Dr. Javier Duarte](https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/).
